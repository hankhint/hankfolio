# Hank's Portfolio


##Description
Here's my jack leg job attempt at making a portfolio website.  I was moving this week and didn't schedule things well enough to get this done. Sorry there isn't much to grade.  I spent about four hours trying to setup the flexbox, especially the horizontal border, never got it right.  I never got to adding the examples of my work, the actual portfolio.  With a resubmission I hope to fully complete this project.
